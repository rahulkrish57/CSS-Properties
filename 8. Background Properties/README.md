# background-image Property
The background-image property sets one or more background images for an element.
The background of an element is the total size of the element,
including padding and border (but not the margin).
Always set a background-color to be used if the image is unavailable.
# background-position Property
The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.
By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element,
and repeated both vertically and horizontally.
# background-attachment Property
The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.
# linear-gradient() Property
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.
