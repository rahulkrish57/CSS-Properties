# block
    Always starts a new line and takes full width
# inline
    Does not start a new line and only take up as much as content space
# horizontal centering
    To horizontally center a block element (like <div>), use margin: auto;
    Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.
